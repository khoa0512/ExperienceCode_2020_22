These series of codes are produced on Matlab. This was a final project for my CBE 562 class.
* The codes aimed at exploring the statistical application of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Multivariate Linear Model (MLM) onto estimating activity coefficient of one-parameter and two-parameter Margules model in Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium problems.
* My curiosity of seeing how two models could estimate and analyze a linear and non-linear model behave.
* Overall, the result was interesting when random errors were applied. 
* For linear case, both model behaved well. For non-linear, the two-parameter behaved better, as expected.
* When applied with ran errors, MLE has more accuracy but less precision than MLM. 
* Paper project is attached for readers interested.
