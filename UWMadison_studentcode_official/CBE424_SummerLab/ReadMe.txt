These codes are meant to showcase my understanding of ploting representations on python.
*I hope the code reflected some of my experience at producing graphs for classwork.
*There are also pdf versions of these reports. They reflect my capacity at writing reports.
*This was an intense class, but I thoroughly enjoyed learning the matplotlib library.
*I also enjoyed studying how to write report professionally.
