Many of the data structure codes are created by my research advisor. I wrote a more basic version of the Machine Learning code, which are
then compared and modified in comparison with my research advisor code. I run the result mostly and tested to see the accuracy of the model.
The Result proves the model to be reliable at high accuracy, but would require stronger processor than a normal computer to train the model.
Once the model is trained, it proves to be much faster than the conventional method of measure Hydrogen Free Energy in the university's lab.
