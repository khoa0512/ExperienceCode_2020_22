This code was produced as my joint collaboration with another undergraduate student on algae productions.
This code is a simplified Julia version that I learned from another research with another advisor in the group.
The longer, complete code of my previous research advisor could not be uploaded due to it belonging to research group advisor.
This code aims at showing my learning and application coming off from that research.
The code proved to produce the same result as other optimizer, but would work well for large-scale data due to efficiency coding.
However, The code does not have dictionary coding, which could lead to future errors with namings. 
I would implement dictionaries for larger, more complicated dataset and analysis to avoid those errors.
