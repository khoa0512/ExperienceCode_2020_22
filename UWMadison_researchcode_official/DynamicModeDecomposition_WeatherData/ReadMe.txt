Many of the structure code was prouced by my research advisors. I was responsible for studying the code, and run the data.
I analyze the data and feed back at the intergrity of the code/analysis.
Overall, weather is unpredictable and the model do not predicted too accurately.
However, the model requires much less processing time, which proves to be useful at optimizing data collection for weather perdictions.
In reality, collecting all the necessary air parameters would require many hours, which would defeat the purpose of predictions.
Data would come in after the event already happened. 
The model could identify unnecessary parameter that would still yield optimal predictions.
This allow for less data needed, which would cut cost and time for the customer.
