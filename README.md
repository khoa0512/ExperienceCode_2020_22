# ExperienceCode_2020_22
my experience coding Julia/matlab/python over the last 2 years and relevant professional reports in school and work.

- These compiles all codes I have studied/compiled over the past two years on Julia and Python.
- There are also reports and projects where these codes are produced, which I hope the reader would enjoyed reading.
- I hope the codes portrayed some of my experience writing Julia, Python, Matlab, and relevant professional reports.

*note: Many of Python and Julia codes are ran using Jupyter Lab.
